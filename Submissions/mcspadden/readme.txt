Project 1

This was a challenging assignment, but I learned a lot. I am having some challenges with the size of the charts and understanding exactly each line of code, but overall I have a good idea of importing data and building simple scatter plots.

Part 1 - Had some trouble, but eventually got the code to load. Not sure what the problem was, after going over the code and correcting errors, eventually it loaded.

Part 2 - I followed the example in class to build the first visualization, omitting some items I did not understand or were not necessary. I did look at travelbyrocket's code to compare to the example in class to look for differences. Items like the # when defining and placing the svg were things that were helpful in getting my code to work in comparison to the example in class.

Part 3 - I copied code from part 2 for part 3/4. I first built the chart, and did the mouse interactin after completing part 5. I origionally had problems with fill when drawing the line, as well as sorting the data. For those items I used the following resources:

I also looked at code from travelbyrocket, shantanu-karnwal, and knights027210. travelbyrocket was helpful in following and comparing to the class code, but the other users were more andvanced and helped clarify the resources found online. Generally I looked online, tried the code, compared my code and other users code, and finally got something to work. 

Part 4 - I based my code off http://bl.ocks.org/WilliamQLiu/76ae20060e19bf42d774. I built this last after completing Part 5.

Part 5 - I copied code from Part 3 to create the 4 charts for section 5. Overall, I am confused on the var = w and var = h for the entire page as I was having trouble changing just part 5. Changing these values in part 5 changed the whole webpage, but when changing the values in other parts, it did not have the same effect. I also don't understand how the 4 plots are arranged on the page.

A few other resources I looked at while completing the assignment:
